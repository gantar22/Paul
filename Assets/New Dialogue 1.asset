    text: Based in Pontiac, Michigan, Dead Velvet is a collection inspired by the
      intersection of decay and luxury. Drawing from Michigan cities such as Detroit,
      Flint, and Pontiac, Dead Velvet attempts to present the stark contrast between
      beauty and natural deterioration over time. The goal of Dead Velvet is to continue
      the current artistic renaissance in Detroit and Pontiac. We want to be a part
      of the comeback by presenting the struggles of our cities front and center.
